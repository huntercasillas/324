1. Of the following, which of the arrays have the same total bytes allocated AND have the same contents as s1 (indicate all that apply)?

- s2, a1, a2, a3, a4


2. Which of the following pairs of pointer values are the same (indicate all that apply)? What expression do you use to compare these pointer values?  Will this same expression always work for comparing the string values (i.e., array content) of two strings?

- s1, e1
- I used the == expression to compare the pointer values.
- No, it won't always work for comparing the string values (i.e. array content).


3. Which of the following arrays can be considered "strings" for the purposes of using them as arguments to strcpy(), strncpy(), strcmp(), strncmp(), and similar string functions (indicate all the apply)? What makes an array a "string" for use with these string functions?

- s1, s2, a1, a2, a3, a4, c1, c2, d1, d2, e1
- A "string" is an array of characters that ends with a null character.


4. Which of the following arrays can be used as arguments to memcpy() and memcmp()?

- All of them (s1, s2, a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b3, b4, c1, c2, d1, d2, e1)


5. Which of the following pairs will always result in strcmp() returning a 0 value (i.e., that the strings are equivalent)? For those pairs for which strcmp() returns a non-zero value (i.e., strings are not equivalent), explain why, in just a few words.

- s1, s2
- s1, a1
- c1, c2
- s1, d1
- s1, e1

- s1, b1 aren't equivalent since b1 doesn't have a null character at the end.
